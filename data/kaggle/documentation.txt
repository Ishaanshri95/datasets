submission1 was a dtc with max_depth=6 (worse than naive predictor)
submission2 was a dtc with max_depth=3. (predicted 0 for all targets, hence as good as naive predictor)
submission3 was wasted (naive again)
submission4 was RFR with class balancing inbuilt into sklearn. (class balancing made all the difference, RFR probably didnt)
